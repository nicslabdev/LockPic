Files jpge.patch and jpgeh.patch are meant to be used with version 1.0.4 of Rich Geldreich's jpeg-compressor, 
available at https://code.google.com/p/jpeg-compressor/; they patch the files jpge.cpp and jpge.h into the required versions
for LockPic.

File stb_image.patch is meant to be used on version 1.33 of the Sean Barrett's stb_image.c class,
available at http://nothings.org/
Please separate the file into header (stb_image.h) and code (stb_image.cpp) after patching.

Copies of the relevant version of the original files are included in this folder.
Both patched files are already included in /jni.
